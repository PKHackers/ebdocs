# Giygan Invasion Procedure as of Earth Year 200X

The invasion occurs in four phases over a 25 Earth-year span.  Each planet targeted for invasion by the Giygans is assigned 4 Overseers to lead the invasion.  The Overseers assigned to Earth are:

- Overseer Zurukai
- Overseer Renoldrax
- Overseer Xelenar
- Overseer Vorastis; Invasion commander

About the Neural Control Being:

- A massive non-sentient lifeform genetically engineered by Mook and Shambler scientists, the NCB reaches out with its telepathic abilities to manipulate the actions of a large population of life forms.  It can not actually direct the concious action of any sentient being, but it can direct one subconscious tendency or another.  This is useful in that the standard Giygan invasion protocol allows for a period of increased violence - in order to cause fighting among the targeted species - followed by a massive wave of fear and submissiveness during the main infantry assault.  NCB's all contain a demi-intelligence core: an organic artificial intelligence which allows them to influence the minds of other beings.  These cores are based on the recorded memories, tactics, and brain patterns of the first Giygan Prætor, Giygas.  Though Giygas died several millennia ago, those beings most strongly effected by the NCB tend to hear and identify that name with the conquering force.

## Andonuts' Conservation of Temporal Probability Theorem
- The Conservation of Temporal Probability Theorem states that changes in the timeline will only occur at the point of the initial time travel.

## Timeline

### Phase 1 (Years 1-10) - Gain a foothold

  * Make initial landing on the planet.  Avoid interaction with indigenous species.
  * Construct a base in a remote location.
  * Grow a neural control being with temporal field amplifiers.

### Phase 2 (Years 11-15) - Begin behavioral modification

  * The Overseers arrive on-planet.
  * Utilize the neural control being to begin increasing violent tendencies in indigenous species.
  * Increase neural shift magnitude as per an asymptotic curve, in order to avoid sudden notice by the dominant species.
  * Begin amassing troops, Starmen and equipment for an assault.
  * Establish other bases around the world.

### Phase 3 (Years 16-20)

#### Section 1
  * Begin neurally shifting specific persons to lead groups of indigenous species against each other.
  * Capture indigenous life forms for experimentation.
  * Begin assault sometime during this period.  Specific time should be chosen based on the dominant species' ability and willingness to resist a Giygan assault.  At that point, begin the second section of Phase 3.
#### Section 2
  * Modify neural shift to induce maximum possible fear and submissiveness.
  * Destroy indigenous command centers and major cities as a show of power.
  * Deploy troops throughout areas of high resistance.

### Phase 4 (Years 21-25)

  * Establish infrastructure and internment camps.
  * Begin wide-scale experimentation on or extermination of indigenous life.
  * Establish space stations and supply routes back to Giygan territory.

## Earth Battle Report as of 200X

- Earth was chosen as a target for invasion nearly 6000 years ago.  The planet showed a remarkable host of resources, including massive oceans (a prime source for inertial drive power) as well as a rich planetary energy field.  The system also contained several other planets, each with their own particular benefits, and a Zexonyte-rich asteroid field.  And to top it all off, the system was in a prime strategic location between Giygan and Xelor territory.  The ancient Scarabians, possessing advanced construction knowledge granted to them by the beings known as Mr. Saturn, developed a series of pyramidal fortresses from which to repel the invading Giygan forces.  The Scarabian culture of the time was wiped out by the invaders.  However, the pyramids themselves lived on.

- The Scarabians had no idea of the true significance of the pyramids - they were tetrahedral energy generators, creating a defense field being generated from the planet.  This effectively acted as a barrier against any oncoming dangers to the world, blocking entry from Giygan starships and teleportation beams.  The Giygan troops who made it to the planet's surface quickly perished from lack of supplies and reinforcements.  The remaining Scarabian survivors recorded the events of the invasion, and spoke of a prophecy given by an artifact the Mr. Saturns brought with them - the Apple of Enlightenment.  The Apple prophecized that the invaders would return once every millenium to attack Earth again.  But it also told of three boys and one girl who would one day save earth from the Giygan menace.

- And indeed they did; the Giygans established bases throughout Earth's star system, mining Zexonyte from the asteroids, amassing forces and warships, and biding their time.  The Prætor, Giygas, realized that the pyramids would last for a great deal of time.  Not being impatient, he simply ordered a check of the status of the tetrahedral barrier once every thousand Earth years.  With the border conflicts against the Xelor Overmind, there was plenty to do in that time:  the territory went back and forth between Giygans and Xelor countless times.  As the Prætorship passed from one Giygan to the next, the importance of Earth began to fade, the millenial checks merely a formality.

- The Reticulans, a spacefaring race merely 30 light years away from Earth, also had interests in the planet and its dominant life form, humans.  Not as advanced as the Giygans, they had no knowledge of tetrahedral geometry.  By the Earth Year 194X, the Giygans had almost completely lost interest in Earth.  The system had become a null point in the battle between Xelor and Giygans, so the Reticulans were allowed to pass into the system.  Their first probe into Earth's atmosphere was marked by the destruction of three Reticulan scoutships in a sparsely populated desert area.  This of course upset the Reticulans, but the fact that they were able to penetrate the field was most important to the Giygans.  Their interest in the resource-rich world restored, they began probing the barrier on a much more frequent basis.  For fourty years, all efforts at passing through were futile.

- Then, in early 198X, the Giygan colony on the fourth planet received an unusual visitor.  A human traveling in an advanced Giygan spider-mech arrived, claiming to hold the secret to entering Earth's atmosphere.  His name was Pokey Minch.  A surprisingly evil and conniving young man, he claimed he had traveled from the future to help the Giygans take over Earth.  Despite their mistrust, Pokey showed the Giygans how to penetrate the tetrahedral field and begin setting up a base.  He became an influential member of the invasion force, though no one really quite understood his motivations.

Phase 1 (Early 198X - Early 199X): Gain a foothold -

- Phase 1 went smoothly;  Minch directed the Giygans to an unpopulated location in the Lost Underworld to establish the NCB facility.  At the order of Pokey, the demi-intelligence core used for the control being was redesigned to be removable.  Xelenar showed resistance to the idea, but Vorastis overruled him, thinking such a feature might be useful later.

Phase 2 (Early to Mid 199X): Begin behavioral modification -

- Phase 2 also went as planned.  The neural control being started by targeting animal and plant life, making them slightly more confrontational.  By the end of this phase, they were genuinely violent towards humans (and targeting of humans began.)  The Overseers were surprised during the final year of this Phase to see a younger version of Pokey arrive in a Phase Distorter and be trained by his counterpart from the future.  The younger Pokey stayed for approximately two months before returning to Late 199X.  This phase also marked the construction of Stonehenge Base, and the Mani Mani statue - a booster device for the NCB allowing specific targeting of human individuals.

Phase 3 (Mid to Late 199X):

- Section 1 of Phase 3 was proceeding normally.  However, in a self-perpetrating time loop, the hero Ness returned to the past from 200X, in the guise of the being "Buzz Buzz."  He told his past self of the future that lay ahead for him.  In this time, Ness and the other three children who were foreseen by the Apple of Enlightenment went on to foil several attempts at controlling specific humans - even destroying the Mani Mani statue and Stonehenge Base.  It was decided that that was the time to strike.

- Section 2 was an utter failure.  The Giygans began by deploying troops throughout Onett and Winters.  However, the four heroes managed to fight through both areas in order to get the materials they needed to travel into the past.

Phase 4 (200X):

  * Establish infrastructure and internment camps.
  * Begin wide-scale experimentation or extermination of indigenous life.
  * Establish space stations and supply routes back to Giygan territory.
