The funds transfer system in place in PIROS is truly unique in the global economy. The basic unit of exchange in PIROS is fixed to control inflation, at the value of one PIROS ruble to one half gallon of pure distilled water. What makes the PIROS monetary system unprecedented is its total reliance on electronic funds. Through a highly encrpyted system of retinal scanners, each citizen in PIROS has direct access to his or her electronic bank account, which can be used to purchase goods throughout PIROS, or to purchase information such as music or electronic books from Earth. Even government taxation is electronic, with the exact amount of your taxes due being deducted from your account at the end of each PIROS year, which is the exact time it takes for the moon to circle Earth, about 28 Earth days. 
	The only paper money in PIROS is brought by tourists, and must be exchanged at the Department of the Treasury of the Great Republic located in the central building of the First Global Spaceport. Rather than send massive amount of paper money back to dozens of countries around the globe, paper money that is exchange is incinerated at PIROS,and the treasurery departments of the countries notified so that they can print more paper money, which is then spent on Earth to supply PIROS with continued shipments of supplies. This type of exchange further insolates the PIROS ruble from inflation, and serves to protect the economy of the newly independant PIROS.
