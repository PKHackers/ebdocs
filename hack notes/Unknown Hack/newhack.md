NOTE: Some stuff below is out of date.

Tomato, a hacker of renown in 2002, is frozen to prevent his death from the Haxiforce-Cannon that was fired against him. Centuries later he awakens, healed, to a changed world.

* People with PK Hack badges on the boards have a form of immortality in-game. A PK Hack badge is a sign of supreme power in this time, and few people will refuse the request of someone bearing one.

* Evil robots (made for peace but went bad) want Tomato so they can control him, make him a weapon and hack the world into a place under their supreme control.

* PK Hackers are in the tubes at Stonehenge Base, and are fine; they access Magicant, a realm where they can practice hacking, through the tubes. Some of higher power can access it without the tubes. (Think "The Matrix", except precautions exist to prevent death.)

* Starman DX's replacement thinks the base is fine, but it's really overrun by enemies. After you fill him in, you access the master controls and shut them all down. When this happens the PK Hackers leave the tubes as part of the emergency system. This is because a lot of energy is needed to wipe the base, and hence they are removed because death could occur from the energy loss.

* The base shutdown (see above) works because the enemies are feeding off the base energy. By altering the flow to a different energy, the creatures lose their power source and shutdown. However, the switch requires vast energy, necessitating a full shutdown of all systems, including the tubes (see effects above).

* Zero_Diamond is the final boss.

* Buzz Buzz is a bot who was activated shortly before you awoke as a reminder system, and his ship struck as Tomato reached full consciousness. He was sent to remind you of who you were and to fill the gaps in your memory, but an underground antihacker destroys him. He gives you an object to collect frequencies from parts of the world to access Magicant, a world made by and for hackers.

* Defeating Magicant's Power Idol in the Ocean of Knowledge will allow Tomato to acquire the knowledge stored across the long centuries since the cryofreezing - his own and the flows' knowledge. This knowledge, spread across the world to those who would accept it, created new breeds of Hax0r. They weren't as strong as the originals since they only had a fraction of the original energy, but it was enough.

* Defeating the Power Idol lets Tomato realize who he once was.

* The Sanctuary Guardians are L33T Hax0rs of old, sent to guard the knowledge until the Great Hax0r of ancient times came to claim a copy.
  These Hax0rs are:
    - \`Frieza (Door Editing)
    - Falcon24 (Teleportation)
    - GuyInSummers (Compression)
    - BlueAntoid (Battle Effects)
    - MrAccident (Text Editing)
    - Shyster (Healing and Damage)
    - Michael_cayer (Event Flags)
    - Flynman (Map Editing)

* NOTE TO SELF: Edit the above list.

* Zero_Diamond was a hacker who was ignored, and who turned to the strands of spacetime to try to overpower those who spurned him. He located Tomato's computer, and by taking the knowledge there, tried to make robots to keep peace. It backfired and they tried to destroy the knowledge of hacking by gathering it and trying to hack the world so it was under their supreme rule. Eight L33T Hax0rs rose up and protected the knowledge, thwarting the robots. But the chaos and shattering of the knowledge flow into eight parts crippled the power...  it survived, at great cost. And no matter what was tried, the flows would not rejoin.

* The robots discovered Tomato was still alive, and began searching for him in the belief that he held the key to global hacking - which he did.

* A prophecy was stated after the robots caused this: "The Great Hax0r of old, who founded our Order, shall return and destroy the Robot with the power of the eight Flows of Knowledge."

* A Haxiforce-Cannon hit Tomato in 2002, and caused the near death state - he was frozen to protect from death and to recover from the wounds. Z_D tried this first as revenge, which caused mass chaos in the knowledge flows. After the freeze, the core of the flow (Tomato's knowledge) was secretly hidden in Magicant. The rest remained flowing until the robot forced it to be severed into the eight segments.

* Z_D's plan with the Haxiforce-Cannon was to disrupt the knowledge flows and grab Tomato's knowledge for his own. It was taken to Magicant, and protected. Barriers to keep Z_D out were formed. Then Z_D discovered Tomato's computer in the spacetime threads...

* Each of the Sanctuary Guardians (L33T Hax0rs) provides a kind of knowledge in place of the little scenes Ness sees at Sanctuaries (i.e, Damage Codes, Teleport Codes, etc).

* Each Hax0r has varying powers. Shyster would heal a lot, Falc would teleport (making him hard to hit), GIS has various compression style stuff, BlueAntoid would use Offense Up/Defense Down, MrA would confuse, etc.

* Poik007 replaces Frank, Atomic Power Tuna IV replaces Frankystein, and the Sharks will look like Manly Fishes (slightly modified).

* Colondee replaces Apple Kid.

* Akuma takes the place of Master Belch. Threed is conquered by lamebots and the Admin Wanted poster replaces the Zombie Paper. Mr_Tenda has offered to be the slime-replacement at the end of the Underground Road.

* Tomato has semi-regular memory emergences, kind of like Cloud in FF7. When these occur, they immobilize him and cause him pain. (Homesickness replacement). Tomato can cure these with sedative capsules (available single quite cheaply, or in a large box for a sizable amount of money).

PREGAME EVENTS:

2002 - Tomato discovers how to alter spacetime. He is attacked by Z_D, who wants the knowledge. Z_D gets SOME information before the other PK Hackers close in on his HQ - he learned to read (but not change) the threads of spacetime. Tomato's is cryofrozen to prevent death and recover from the Haxiforce Cannon blast. Tomato's mind data is copied and stored in the Hacker Realm, Magicant.

2003 - Z_D uses his knowledge to find Tomato's computer. He acquires more knowledge, but is discovered and the computer data is withheld. Z_D makes a team of "peace" robots - their true purpose is stealing the knowledge and presenting it to Z_D so he can hack the world to his liking. The knowledge flows are separated and the robots are fought off. The flows refuse to rejoin, and one PK Hacker states that only Tomato has the power to link them together. Machines are constructed to allow access to Magicant - formerly only those with knowledge of all the PK Hacking arts could enter, but since the flow division, this is impossible to all but the most powerful.

2004 - The L33t Hackers each go to a remote part of the world. Here, they hide from Z_D's stealth forces and teach others the arts.

2006 - Z_D convinces the government that the Hackers have great power and pose a threat. For three days military forces attack the Hackers, who defend themselves with alarming ease. Peace is established between the Hackers and the governments. The world learns of the arts. Z_D disappears mysteriously.

2008 - The High Circle of Hackers, consisting of the L33T Hackers and a few apprentices, is formed. Over the centuries it will pick the occasional person who shows the maturity, knowledge and skill in the power to join them.

2009 - The first classes are offered to teach the arts. Extreme care is taken in the selections. Few enter the arts out of fear that they could harm themselves or others. Most who enter drop out.

2014 - The hackers discover the form of immortality - they can still die, but they don't age. The hackers learn to control most aspects of their appearance.

2025 - The Antiwarper is developped for banks, homes, workplaces and other such to prevent hackers from simply teleporting in, stealing information or money, and warping away.

2048 - World environmental problems are eliminated for the most part by the hackers.

2078 - The Hacking Academy opens in Winters.

2103 - The first reality distorter weapons are made.

2147 - Knowledge is leaked from the Academy. People who were rejected by the Academy try to learn the arts. Thousands of people die from misusing their powers. The High Circle steps in and destroys most of the leaked documents, but a few survive. Even by 2502, the documents last, and some gangs/people use the arts crudely yet efficiently to cause havoc.

2156 - Z_D reappears. A close shave occurs with the cryocapsule, which is nearly found. Tomato is relocated. Z_D starts attacking the Academy in secret, and every five or six months a small force of horridly mutated creatures attacks.

2186 - Basic PK Hacking is taught in schools. More advanced courses are taught in universities, but if one seeks to have it as their job and not just a useful skill, they must still be accepted at the Hacking Academy.

2207 - Several cults that say that the Hacking power is from an ultimate evil join forces and attack the Hacking Academy. The attack is a failure.

2236 - Magicant is redesigned by the High Circle.

2295 - The info drone to give information to Tomato upon awakening is developed.

2376 - Z_D reappears and manages to steal the cryocapsule. He is shocked to find Tomato's mind is blank, then realizes the information must've been stored in Magicant. Z_D manages to return the capsule, but not before the loss is noted by the High Circle.

2377 - Z_D attacks Magicant for the first time.

2410 - Z_D unites several guilds and cults against the Hackers and forms a small army. Magicant is attacked; the hackers lose control of it. A new version of Magicant is created and the old one is obliterated.

2412 - The number of registered, known, and currently living hackers reaches 100,000.

2433 - Tomato is relocated again.

2498 - A family moves into the house where Tomato is frozen. The door to Tomato's room is locked, and the family never bothers to enter.

2501 - Tomato begins to pull out of his trance.

2502 - Game events.

GAME EVENTS:

 - Tomato awakens to the meteor (Ness' head is replaced by a bluish cryosuit helm).

 - Tomato's room has been locked for a long time, and new homeowners were afraid to enter and find what was inside. Alternately, the door may have been plastered over.

 - Tracy is replaced by a random Japanese schoolgirl, who is taking a first-level PK Hax0ring class. ("Who are you?! Get out of here!")

 - The gift box holds an Old Distorter ("A small-scale reality distorter used by PK Hax0rs. This one has a bunch of broken tubes and looks like it just barely works."). She has it because of the class she's taking.

 - Ness' mom. ("Who are you?" "...I can't remember anything except my name... Tomato." "Hmm... what's that medallion? <long pause> ...! Alright, you can stay here tonight! Er, as long as you like!" "<Tomato to self> What was that about?")

 - Ness' mom, second time. ("Wonder what that sound was...")

 - The cops are replaced by average Japanese people. The roadblocks are replaced by laser blockades or debris from the meteor/ship. Some cops are replaced by diggers who are removing said debris.

 - Picky is a camera-bot owned by a news team that's taken over the currently empty Minch house as a base-of-operations for the reporting.

 - King is largely the same.

 - When you return home, you tell Ness' mom that debris was in the way of reaching the meteor. You go off to sleep and awaken to knocking; it's a reporter. He says the debris was removed, but moments after, unreasoning terror hit them. Since a VERY expensive camera-bot was left up there, this one was chosen by drawing straws to get it back. He knew Tomato was curious (from the talking at the hill), so he decided to invite him along. ("Hey kid, wanna see that ship?")

 - The reporter's attacks: ?, ?, ?, ?.

 - After getting the Picky/bot ("SYSTEMS ONLINE... Damage report: 0%." "Whew... it's fine and undamaged. I'd hate to have to foot the bill for one of these...") and walking by the meteor, the Buzz-Buzz-replacing drone appears. ("PK Hax0r... after centuries, you have awoken. I am <name>, a drone sent to remind you of who you once were, and the destiny that may be in your hands now.")

 - The reporter, realizing Tomato has a PK Hack badge (which is a symbol of high power in this time) freaks out a bit.

 - Starman Jr is a higher form of one of the robots that resulted in the hackers dividing the knowledge flow. After beating him, Buzz Buzz says some vague stuff about the division of the flows.

 - After entering the reporter/Minch house, talk to the head reporter (replaces Aloysius). The reporter who followed leaves, taking the bot upstairs - talking to it yields ("It's shutdown currently.") Replace the sound made after Aloysius/head reporter goes upstairs with a "powering-down" kind of sound.

 - Following this, the Buzz-Buzz-drone is mistaken for an insect, and is struck. Talking to it after yields: ("I was going to give you a copy of all eight knowledge flows, so you could enter the Hacker Realm of Magicant. But I don't have the energy left to do the telepathic info transfer now. And that knowledge is linked to me: if I die, it is instantly deleted from my circuitry. So taking the datachip with the flows on it wouldn't work. There is one other way...I could modify one of my blank datachips to receive the knowledge flow frequencies, and you could travel to meet the eight L33T Hax0rs of old who guard the knowledge. If you succeed, Magicant will be opened to you. This is the only other chance... goodbye, PK Hax0r. Good luck to you.") ("Tomato got the Datachip.")

 - The aforementioned Picky-bot replaces the camera guy.

 - Enemies: Runaway Dogs are ?, Coil Snakes are ?, Spiteful Crows are ?.

 - Frank is replaced by Poik007, the Frankystein Mark II is replaced by the Atomic Power Tuna IV, and the Sharks look like (slightly modified) Manly Fishes.

 - B.H. Pirkle is replaced by ?.
