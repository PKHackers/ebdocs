## Subquest 3: Capture Frankystein Mark I

- Requirements - Gain access to the back lot of the arcade, and defeat the S.O. Nerd who guards the Frankystein.

### If Ness is part of the group

Ness tells the others to go around to the outside of the fence, to guard the machine once he moves it over.  He uses his as-yet-mild PSI to help him slip the Frankystein through the fence.  As soon as he completes this, a South Onett leader (likely Toby Strong or Brett "Yes Man" Harmon) will show up to see progress on the machine.  Spotting Ness, the two go into a battle (mildly animated, with music, sound effects, and snowball splatter effects).  Ness is defeated and dragged away.  Picky and the others sadly return to base.

### If Subquest 4 has already begun

Picky and the others strain to lift the machine, but it doesn't work.  A South Onett leader (likely Toby Strong or Brett "Yes Man" Harmon) will show up to see progress on the machine.  A battle begins - ending text will activate a sequence in which a stray snowball activates the Frankystein's snow cannon, blasting the boss through the fence.  Picky and Co. then acquire the machine.  The three return to the base.

Upon making their report to Thimble, a short cutscene ensues, where Ness is in a room identical to that of the house at Beak Point, but much more structurally sound.  Ness speaks with a leader of the S.O.'s, who tells him that he's become a nuisance.  Ness reassures the leader that his friends will rescue him, no matter what.

## Subquest 4: Kidnapping of Ness

- Required Map Changes - See Subquest 3
- Required Item Additions - None
- Required Enemy Additions - Snow Ninja
- Other Notable Changes - Change Beak Point tileset to incorporate massive amounts of internal snow.  Remove running guy sequence from the Library 2F, change door to allow "entrance."  Add TPT sprites of the group to the hamburger shop.
- Requirements - Ness must be kidnapped for this quest.

### If Subquest 3 has not been completed

After a given time period (probably set by a delivery flag) Ness will need to use the restroom.  Picky indicates some nearby trees as a potential rest stop, but Ness prefers to go to the Library.  The group goes with him as far as the burger shop, and Ness goes into the Library, and takes care of business.  As he leaves the Library, he is ambushed by a gang of Snow Ninjas.  These dangerous agents of the South Onettians descend and snow-ball him into submission before he can even blink.  A little while later, Picky and Co get impatient and go looking for Ness, when they find a crowd of people outside the Library, upon which point they learn that Ness has been kidnapped.  Reporting in to Thimble, he tells them that their priority is to stop the S.O.'s, no matter how much they need Ness.

Once the cutscene from subquest 3 is complete, Picky decides that the Frankystein is more than powerful enough to break Ness out of wherever he is.  Ian tells you that the southwest region of Onett has been experiencing a lot of activity lately.  This activates a large amount of guarditude around the house, as well as a Hot Spot in back.  The door is locked and guarded.  If you check the door, somebody will suggest checking for a window in back.  Behind the house, Frankystein will start chugging and smoking, and discharge its snow cannon all at once.  The house will be devastated, and Ness will be freed.  However, the cannon will be inactive and need repairs.  Once you return to the treehouse, Frankystein will be removed from your custody.

### Compressed air tank
To find the Air tank, you must go to South Onett and enter the junkyard.  It will be easily spotted, but you must defeat some goons and their dogs.

### Pressure valve
Lier X. Agerate has just completed Mall Santa school!  Unfortunately, the post office won't deliver his mail after that spork incident.  So, Ness must sneak into the back room of the post office, evade a security guard, and obtain the package containing Lier's costume.  Of course, you can take other packages as well...

### Firing chamber
An old man is locked out of his house.  If you agree to help him, he will give you a metal detector.  Use it to seek out the key he dropped somewhere in Onett...  If you bring back the key, he will let you into the house and give you a Firing chamber (however, he will take back the metal detector.).
