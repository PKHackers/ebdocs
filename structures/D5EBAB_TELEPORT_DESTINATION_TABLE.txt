1F 21 TELEPORT DATA:
--------------------
By michael_cayer

Lying between 15EDAB and 15F4F2 is the data for all the 1F 21 [] codes from 00 to 
E8. It seems anything from E9 to FF was never meant to be accessed by this code.

Finding entries: 15EDAB + 0x8 * entry number. So entry 16 is 15EDAB + 0x8 * 0x16;
that is, 15EE5B is the entry for 1F 21 16.

Data structure:
AA AA BB BB CC DD EE EE

AA = X coordinate. This uses the same coordinate system as PSI Teleport.
BB = Y coordinate.
CC = What way to face after warping.
DD = Warp style. This uses entries from 101600; the effect list below remains for no real reason.

	00 = The screen goes black instantly and fades in, standard-door style.
        01 = Standard door-style warp.
        02 = Standard door-style warp, but the screen turns white instead of black.
        03 = Standard door-style warp.
        04 = Standard door-style warp, with a door sound.
        05 = Touching a hole warp - falling sound and the screen slides up.
        06 = Standard door-style warp.
        07 = Standard door-style warp, with a door sound.
        08 = Standard door-style warp, with a door sound.
        09 = Standard door-style warp, with a door sound.
        0A = Standard door-style warp.
        0B = ...Uhm, freaky. Try it for yourself, you'll see what I mean.
        0C = Standard door-style warp.
        0D = Standard door-style warp.
        0E = Standard door-style warp, but the screen turns white instead of black.
        0F = Standard door-style warp, but makes a weird sound.
        10 = Phase Distorter III-like warp.
        11 = Moonside style warp.
        12 = Moonside style warp.
        13 = Moonside style warp.
        14 = Moonside style warp.
        15 = Moonside style warp.
        16 = Moonside style warp.
        17 = Moonside style warp.
        18 = Moonside style warp.
        19 = Moonside style warp.
        1A = Moonside style warp.
        1B = Moonside style warp.
        1C = Standard door-style warp.
        1D = Standard door-style warp, but the screen turns white instead of black. Slower than 02.
        1E = Same as 1D. Makes a weird sound.
        1F = Ghost-filled tunnel warp.
        20 = Ghost-filled tunnel warp.
        21 = Touching a hole warp - falling sound and the screen slides up.

EE = Unknown.
