FREQUENCY / TSV BLOCKS
======================
Frequency/TSV blocks consist of: 
 - Bytes that represent note frequencies
 - TSVs (Tempo / Style / Volume, a two-byte modifier of stuff)
 - Unknowns

They are pointed to from 4FB47. Pointers in this table use an odd format:
<high> <low> <middle>. For example, C58000 would be represented as 
C5 00 80.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

TSVs look like this: 
XX YZ

XX - Tempo: Cycles per note?
 Y - Style: ???
 Z - Volume.



Entry Organization
==================
The first two bytes are equal to:
  Distance from the third byte to the end, minus one.

Following this is a header of sorts; it appears to go on until an FF
is reached, which marks the end of the header.

The data portion that follows is frequency bytes, TSVs and unknowns. 
Research is continuing.


Notes
=====
* How timing is handled is unknown.
* How the difference between freqs and TSVs is determined is unknown, 
  though the 0x80 bit is suspected (one for freq, zero for TSV).
