What follows is attempted documentation of the sound samples available to us through SNESSOR95.  This should in no way be taken to be a wholly accurate account of the data, as descriptions are rather vague and the software used to achieve these results can not be entirely trusted - the DOS version of SNESSOR reveals different numbers of samples in most of the blocks, although those do not carry any seemingly valid sound information.  This should be taken as more a general guide to where specific sounds lie in the ROM.  Hopefully it will be updated as time goes on and our knowledge of music in EarthBound expands.
