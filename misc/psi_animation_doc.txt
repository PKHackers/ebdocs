    Compressed arrangements. The decompressed format is very simple - 1 byte / 8x8 tile.
    There are 1024 bytes per frame: the first 64 (corresponding to the first two lines)
    and the last 64 (corresponding to the last two lines) are never seen. So the data is
    for 32x32, but you see 32x28. :P

    PSEUDOCODE:
    while (counter < length of decompressed area divided by 1024) {
      while (y < 30) {
        while (x < 32) {
          get tile (y * 32 + x)
          draw at location 8*x, 8*y
          increment x
        }
        reset x
        increment y
      }
      y = 2 // Skip first two lines, used instead of 0-28 to make the "get tile" step non-evil
      increment counter
    }
