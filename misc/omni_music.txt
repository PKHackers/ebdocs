Map Music and Events

Involved databanks:
•0F5AF1 to 0F5C38 = Map music/event flag correlations pointer table
•0F5C39 to 0F63DF = Map music/event flag correlation table

Pointer table formatting: AA AA

2 byte pointer table, nothing fancy.  The base address is 0xF0200. (0xAAAA + 0xF0200 = Address)  These pointers represent musical values as seen in the map editor.

Correlation table formatting: AA AA BB 00

AA AA = Event flag upon which to play a different music.
BB    = Music value to play.
00    = Terminator.

This table is just kind of... put together.  There's no real division between different entries.  However, there is a terminator value.  At the end of each string of possible tracks, there is a default musical value where the flag is 00 00.  This default value stops the game from reading possible flags any farther than that.

Music value 1 as code example:
